== How to build this program ==

First, get a copy of the complete tree. If you have SVN, do this:

  svn checkout http://svn.b.evanheidtmann.info/escape/escape-trajectory

Next, the CVODE includes and libraries need to be generated. First, change
to the sundials directory:

  cd sundials

Then run the configure script with the correct PREFIX argument. If the
escape-trajectory folder is in /home/joe/somewhere, then the command is:

  ./configure --prefix=/home/joe/somewhere/escape-trajectory

If that runs successfully, just make and install CVODE:

  make
  make install

Now you're ready to build the trajectory generator. Go back to the root of
the source tree:

  cd ..

And build:

  make

Enjoy!
